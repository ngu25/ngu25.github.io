## **One of the lessons I have learned in my own life is that if you don’t act on life, life has a habit of acting on you. The days slip into weeks, the weeks slip into months and the months slip into years. Pretty soon it’s all over and you are left with nothing more than a heart filled with regret over a life half lived.**

## **Finding your calling doesn’t mean you must leave the job you now have. It simply means you need to bring more of yourself into your work and focus on the things you do best. It means you have to stop waiting for other people to make the changes you desire and, as Mahatma Gandhi noted: “Be the change that you wish to see most in your world.” And once you do, your life will change.**

This simple act will increase your awareness of how poorly you concentrate and, since awareness is the first step to change, help you to build the skills you need for a clearer, quieter mind.**

Proactive people are still influenced by external stimuli, whether physical, social, or psychological.

## **psychologists have noted that there are four levels of competence or learning. The first, known as “unconscious incompetence,” is when you don’t know what you don’t know. For example, you might not even be aware of the fact that something like speed-reading exists. So, you’re also not aware that you’re currently not capable of doing it. In the next level, known as “conscious incompetence,” you’re aware of what you don’t know. For example, you’re aware that people have learned to read and comprehend much faster through speed-reading techniques, but you yourself have not had any training in this area, nor do you understand what tools are necessary to become a speed-reader. The third level is “conscious competence.” What this means is that you’re aware of a skill and have the capacity to perform that skill, but only when you actively put your mind to it. You can do it, but it takes work.**

## **Expose yourself to unusual experiences. When management guru Peter Drucker was asked for one thing that would make a person better in business, he responded, “Learn to play the violin.” Different experiences give rise to different tools. Find out what your kids are interested in and why. Stimulate your creativity. Learn about things that are out of the mainstream. Travel to weird and exotic places. Knowing one’s own industry and one’s native markets is not enough to compete in the future. Take a deep and boundless curiosity about things outside your own profession and comfort zone.**

## **When you keep forecasting that simple, you free up time and bandwidth for other activities. I like studying the investing behaviors that never change, and I’d never have the time to do that if I spent my day predicting what the economy will do next quarter. The same is true in virtually every field. The more precise you try to be, the less time you have to focus on big-picture rules that are probably more important. It’s less about admitting that we can’t forecast, and more about acknowledging that if your forecast is merely good enough, you can invest your time and resources more efficiently elsewhere.**

It’s sensory reality and abstract thought working together that unlocks the brain’s full potential.**

Each day you look forward to getting started, and the work brings out the best in you. On the other hand, when you’re doing something just because you have to, you lack unconscious support. All you have is the best efforts of the ego.**

## **I learned a great fear of being wrong that shifted my mind-set from thinking “I’m right” to asking myself “How do I know I’m right?” And I saw clearly that the best way to answer this question is by finding other independent thinkers who are on the same mission as me and who see things differently from me. By engaging them in thoughtful disagreement, I’d be able to understand their reasoning and have them stress-test mine. That way, we can all raise our probability of being right. In other words, I just want to be right—I don’t care if the right answer comes from me. So I learned to be radically open-minded to allow others to point out what I might be missing. I saw that the only way I could succeed would be to: 1. Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning. 2. Know when not to have an opinion. 3. Develop, test, and systemize timeless and universal principles. 4. Balance risks in ways that keep the big upside while reducing the downside.**

## **Why should any creature be social? Why not just go it alone? The reason is that individuals can sometimes accomplish things together that they can’t accomplish by themselves. This principle has guided the evolution of life on earth from the start. Approximately four billion years ago, molecules joined together to form cells. About two billion years later, cells joined together to form more complex cells. And then a billion years later, these more complex cells joined together to form multicellular organisms. These collectives evolved because the participating individuals could, by working together, spread their genetic material in new and more effective ways.**

## **Too often, we get caught up efficiently doing ineffective things, focusing solely on the work that will get us through the day. The idea isn’t to find oneself another environment tomorrow—be it a new job or a new economy—but to be constantly creating the environment and community you want for yourself, no matter what may occur.**

## **At each stage, we pulled a bit of labor out of agriculture and into new industries that managed, leveraged, or improved the very agriculture the labor had originally come from. The steadily increasing levels of labor specialization and urbanization first gave us towns, then city-states, then kingdoms, and eventually empires.**

## **The only countries in a post-2022 world that might be able to maintain an overseas empire are those that can have three things going for them: a serious cultural superiority complex, a military capable of reliably projecting power onto locations that cannot effectively resist, and lots and lots and lots and LOTS of disposable young people.**

## **The Industrial Revolution came for water transport as well. It just took a bit longer, for a couple of semi-obvious technical reasons. First, the steam engine was invented well before steel became available in large quantities. The early steamships were still made of wood. Steam engines ran on coal. Coal burns at over 3,000 degrees. It doesn’t take a doctorate in chemistry to understand the complication. Second, coal burns and then it is gone, while the**

## **The best artists tend to be the ones with the most sensitive antennae to draw in the energy resonating at a particular moment. Many great artists first develop sensitive antennae not to create art but to protect themselves. They have to protect themselves because everything hurts more. They feel everything more deeply.**

## **How do we pick up on a signal that can neither be heard nor be defined? The answer is not to look for it. Nor do we attempt to predict or analyze our way into it. Instead, we create an open space that allows it. A space so free of the normal overpacked condition of our minds that it functions as a vacuum. Drawing down the ideas that the universe is making available.**

## **Listening without prejudice is how we grow and learn as people. More often than not, there are no right answers, just different perspectives. The more perspectives we can learn to see, the greater our understanding becomes. Our filter can begin to more accurately approach what truly is, rather than a narrow sliver interpreted through our bias.**

## **To figure out which economies are most vulnerable to aging, compare the number of working-age people to the number of people who are older than 64 or younger than 15—also known as the “dependency ratio.” When the dependency ratio is rising, fewer workers are available to support the growing number of retirees, and growth suffers.**

Although a case can be made that services will come to rival manufacturing as a catalyst for sustained growth, that day has yet to arrive. For now, the best investment binges are still focused on manufacturing and technology.**

## **Wishful thinking – known more formally as the sunk cost fallacy – is another important cognitive bias. It leads us to invest precious resources into a losing proposition in the vain hope of recouping previous losses. This tendency to “double down” has been at the heart of many financial scandals, such as when rogue financial traders trap themselves in a downward spiral of increasingly large and risky bets that, in some cases, have contributed to institutional failure and even global crises.**

## **Another version of confirmation bias is the halo effect, as described in Phil Rosenzweig’s book with the same title.10 This is the tendency for one important aspect of a person (or a company) to shape perceptions of the whole in ways not supported by the facts. In his research on the halo effect, Rosenzweig showed that it powerfully distorts our thinking about company performance. He explains that it’s common to assume a company with a robust financial performance has a sound strategy and strong leadership. However, when performance wanes, we’re often quick to conclude that its strategy is unsound and that its CEO has become arrogant.**
