## > Projects 🚀

* **DigiStep: A digital Stepper Motor Controller design using PSoC4200**  
Designed and implemented is a stepper motor controller using a couple of Flip-Flops, Multiplexers and Logic Gates. Putting the design inside a Programmable SoC would be 
like a highly configurable driver. No exclusive controller chip is required and multiple controller logics can be implemented in a single  PSoC chip. 
This stepper driver efficiently suits the 28BYJ-48 unipolar stepper motor and is intended for applications in Printers, Robotic Arms, High torque tractions etc.  

* **AquaLoop: A 4-20mA current loop based Water Level Indicator**  
Project AquaLoop, design of water tank level indicators. The main target was to make the system robust, low noise, less lossy over a distance for signal transmission.
It's fully designed with basic, discrete components using a BC547 based water level indicator circuit, OPA211 Op-Amp for signal conditioning, UA741 Op-Amp with BC557 
as a current transmitter, LM393 comparators for driving the bar LEDs and an R2R ladder network for signal conditioning. No microcontroller, No coding, All analog and data conversion.  

* **Miniature BLE Automation**  
Implementation of multichannel Bluetooth Low Energy appliance control system with Taiyo Yuden BLE (nRF52811) module. Unique keyword transmission is achieved to BLE module 
from smartphone via UART interface for multichannel toggling.  

* **Multiutility Agricultural Robot**  
Multiutility AGRI-Bot is a multipurpose machine that performs field agricultural tasks. With this Bot, the plan is to implement IoT and Image processing techniques using set 
of sensors and monitors which visualises data via MATLAB and quick, effective analysis can be done via the same. The main objective here is to bring technology and farming 
closer and make the tasks easier thereby easing the process and bringing development in the field of Agriculture.  

* **MicroPython Series - ESP8266**  
MicroPython #1: Introduction and Gearing Up  
MicroPython #2: Triggering I/O's  
MicroPython #3: PWM, LED Fade  
MicroPython #4: Interfacing Sensors  

* **Low Cost Bedside Patient Monitoring System for the Clinical Community Battling COVID-19**  
The health care community requires effective monitoring of vital signs to identify and treat at-risk patients. Such monitoring becomes more relevant in the case of diseases 
like COVID-19. The availability of bedside patient monitors remains limited, given the enormous demand placed on our already overstretched health care facilities comprising 
of nursing homes, hospitals (including tertiary ones). Our team is proposing a very inexpensive solution for the healthcare sector that will in patient monitoring.  

* **GPS Location Tracking System**  
Project descriptionGPS Live Data Monitoring is a system in which the location data is acquired from an onboard GPS module. The data is then processed via .kml wrapper which 
displays the location (lat, long, height) on Google Earth. Data is acquired and stored in a SD-Card using ATMEGA 328P Microcontroller (Arduino). The main objective is to 
visualise and track location data with compact and low cost electronic implementation.
